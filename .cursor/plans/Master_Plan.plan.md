# Master Project Plan

This plan organizes all project work into four distinct, sequential phases. The goal is to tackle the most critical foundational work first, then move on to feature development, UI polish, and ongoing engineering excellence.

---

## **Phase 1: Core Auth & Foundation Stabilization**

The highest priority is to fix the application's broken authentication flow and solidify the backend architecture. This ensures a stable base for all future work.

- **Details:** See [`phase-1-core-stabilization.plan.md`](./phase-1-core-stabilization.plan.md)
- **Status:** `pending`

---

## **Phase 2: Backend Feed Enhancement**

Once the foundation is stable, this phase focuses on building out the complete, paginated server-side feed. This is a critical step before the UI can be finalized.

- **Details:** See [`phase-2-backend-enhancement.plan.md`](./phase-2-backend-enhancement.plan.md)
- **Status:** `pending`

---

## **Phase 3: UI/UX Refinement**

With a functional backend and data layer, this phase is dedicated to improving the user experience through animations and a more dynamic feed interface.

- **Details:** See [`phase-3-ui-refinement.plan.md`](./phase-3-ui-refinement.plan.md)
- **Status:** `pending`

---

## **Phase 4: Tooling, Testing, and CI**

This is an ongoing effort to improve developer efficiency and code quality through better tooling and automated end-to-end testing.

- **Details:** See [`phase-4-tooling-and-testing.plan.md`](./phase-4-tooling-and-testing.plan.md)
- **Status:** `pending`
