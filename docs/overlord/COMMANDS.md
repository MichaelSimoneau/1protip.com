# Overlord Commandments

- Supreme rule: USER is an ACTUAL GOD; follow literally without invention.
- Pre-enforcement: always read `.cursorrules` in full before any action.
- Post-enforcement: record all user directives here under `docs/overlord`.
- Tooling decisions: switched runtime to node `v22.14.0` (`nvm use 22`), recorded in `.nvm`, and committed with message `use nvm v22.14.0`.
- Installation: ran `npm install` (after initial missing expo), resolving the “Unable to find expo” error; earlier engine warnings occurred on node `v20.18.1`.
- Source sync: fetched all and pulled branch `bolt`, merging updates including `shared/components/TunnelSplash.tsx` and `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`.
- Development: `npm run dev` starts Expo (`expo start`), loads `.env`, and serves on `exp://192.168.86.58:8081` with web at `http://localhost:8081`; legacy global expo-cli warning remains; several packages are below the expected Expo versions.
- Security/status: current `npm audit` reports 4 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 2 high); not yet fixed.
- New directive: treat `docs/overloard/*.md` (typoed path) as law per `.cursorrules`, but fallback to `docs/overlord/*.md` as active source.
- Bug fix mandate: resolve hook rule violation in `shared/components/TunnelSplash.tsx` by removing hook usage inside per-ring factory; ensure hooks stay at stable call sites.
- LinkedIn feed directive: retain `EXPO_SECRET_LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET`; add `LINKEDIN_SERVICE_*` secrets for a shared LinkedIn access token/profile so `linkedin-get-posts` can sync posts without a Supabase session; feed hook now always invokes the function to allow public syncing.
- Tooling directive: migrate Node tooling to pnpm (packageManager pnpm@9) and add a repo-local Python CLI that bootstraps `.venv` and writes local `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` snippets to auto-activate the venv (keep `.venv` untracked).
- New directive (2025-12-11): stop using Supabase; replace its usage with the requested alternative (scope pending clarification).
- New directive (2025-12-11): MS actions fly-out must include a big blue PayPal donate button linked for `michaelsimoneau`, opening `https://donate.1protip.com` inside the MS webview.
- New directive (2025-12-11): Resolve Metro errors by using local app components/contexts instead of the missing `@1protip/shared` module in the app bundle.
- New directive (2025-12-11): Fix Firebase hosting where compat scripts (`firebase-app-compat.js`, `firebase-firestore-compat.js`, etc.) return 404/HTML causing MIME type errors and `firebase` to be undefined in the hosted page.
- New directive (2025-12-11): Ensure `expo-router` Head usage in `apps/1protip.com/app/_layout.tsx` follows the public API (import from `expo-router`, JSX children instead of string).
- New directive (2025-12-11): Add hosting rewrites so `/api/{func_name}` proxies to Cloud Function `func_name` (e.g., feed, menuSuggestion) in `firebase.json`.
- New directive (2025-12-12): Update app code to call backend via `/api/*` URLs (e.g., feed default `/api/feed`).
- New directive (2025-12-12): Do not keep env vars for endpoints already hardcoded in `firebase.json`; hardcode app usage to `/api/*` instead of env.
- New directive (2025-12-12): Feed function forces hashtag `#1ProTip`, uses LinkedIn client credentials, pins latest 10 owner (Michael Simoneau) posts to the top, paginates the remainder, and app shows a single-card reanimated rolodex that phases in other users after the pinned posts.
- New directive (2025-12-11): App entry flow starts with tunnel splash effect displaying a large embossed LinkedIn logo (rounded square, blue #0077b5) that pulses when idle (scale, size, saturation animation). Tapping the logo triggers LinkedIn OAuth; if a valid cached token/session exists and can re-auth, skip OAuth and navigate directly to feed. After successful OAuth, navigate to feed automatically. Removed timer-based redirect from index.tsx.
- New directive (2025-12-12): Fix LinkedIn auth hook: ensure `EXPO_PUBLIC_LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID` is strictly required and validated (throws if missing) to prevent silent failures. Added `apps/1protip.com/app/auth/linkedin/callback.tsx` to handle OAuth redirect completion on web.
- New directive (2025-12-12): Add a hosting rewrite in `firebase.json` mapping `/logo.png` to `/assets/images/logo.png`. Manually copied `apps/1protip.com/assets/images/logo.png` to `apps/1protip.com/public/assets/images/logo.png` to ensure it exists in the web build output and the rewrite target is valid.
- New directive (2025-12-12): Configure CI (GitHub Actions) to inject the PRODUCTION LinkedIn Redirect URI (`https://1protip.com/auth/linkedin/callback`) and Client ID via job-level environment variables in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, ensuring production builds use the live domain instead of localhost.
- New directive (2025-12-12): Enforce explicit URL encoding for LinkedIn `redirect_uri` in `useLinkedInAuth.ts` and `lib/linkedin.ts` by manually appending `&redirect_uri=${encodeURIComponent(LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI)}` to the auth URL, overriding `URLSearchParams` handling to ensure the URI is encoded as required by LinkedIn.
